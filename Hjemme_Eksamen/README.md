#To run the application, write the following commands in the compiler/command prompt:
  * make 		(compiles the program)
  * ./indexer cacm	(indexes all the documents from the directory "cacm" and starts a simple web-server)

#Open your internet application and enter the following link: http://localhost:8080/
  * This will launch a simple search engine to search on the documents in the cacm directory
